Here are links to something I did at spare time:

- [PdfOCRer](https://github.com/msmarkgu/PdfOCRer): A Python script that runs Paddle OCR on a possibly unsearchable PDF to make it searchable. 

- [ChinesePatentParser](https://github.com/msmarkgu/ChinesePatentParser): A Python script that can parse a Chinese patent of invention type to extract fields, sections, subsections in it. 

- [PatentAnalyzer]([https://](https://gemlight.42web.io/patent_analysis.php)): An online tool to summarize and compare patent claims, to check potential infringement.
