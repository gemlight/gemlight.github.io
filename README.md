Here are links to something I did at spare time:

- [PdfOCRer](https://github.com/msmarkgu/PdfOCRer): A Python script that runs Paddle OCR on a possibly unsearchable PDF to make it searchable. 

- [ChinesePatentParser](https://github.com/msmarkgu/ChinesePatentParser): A Python script that can parse a Chinese patent of invention type to extract fields, sections, subsections in it. 

- [PatentAnalyzer](https://gemlight.42web.io/PatentAI/patent_analysis.php): An online AI-based Patent Analyzer that can analyze patents, summarize patent claims, evaluate originality (novelty and non-obviousness), compare partents, as well as dtect potential infringement using popular AI models like DeepSeek, Gemini, Llama, and Mistral. It supports English, Chinese, French and Japanese languages. 

- [AI Chat Buddy](https://gemlight.42web.io/AIBuddy/index.php)): Ask questions and interact with AI Models. It allows you to choose popular LLMs like DeepSeek, Gemini and Llama, adjust model behaviors by setting system instructions and model temperature, and save conversations to PDF (conversation in PDF) or as HTML (conversation in HTML).
